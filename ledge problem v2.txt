You must measure a ledge without falling into it and you are holding on to your 
smart hat (it is the year one kajillion X) with one hand because of a stiff 
breeze. You could run along the edge with a measuring tape, but that's unsafe. 
How could it be measured safely, using what is known of mathematics? 

Two methods I could use to measure would be to make either a triangle, or a 
trapeze, with the largest side as the side to measure. The triangle's largest 
side would also rest on the ledge. The base of the trapeze would rest on the ledge. 

Moving from the ledge with a measuring tape. 
x*cos(u) + small base of trapeze + y*sin(u) = base of trapeze 

But angles are hard to measure. A better way must be found. 
Create a square, and have it be x*2^0.5 in length of hypotenuse 
when divided into a triangle. You can take the square with you. 

Moving on the ledge with your measuring tape, and leaving from the 
corner of the square (use the measuring tape to leave from it at a 
good angle!) you measure the length L of the base of the trapeze. 
You must rotate the square so it points away from you and towards 
the ledge you are measuring. When the corner of the ledge is pointed 
at by the square corner, you've reached the point where you could 
measure that length. You do not, of course! That's the unsafest part. 
You mark that length L, and return with your data, safe and sound.
